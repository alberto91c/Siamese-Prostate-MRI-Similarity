# Siamese-Prostate-MRI-Similarity
This repository contain the code for the model trained in the paper "Multi-modal siamese network for diagnostically similar lesion retrieval in prostate MRI"

### About
The paper proposes a CBIR model for the retrieval of diagnostically similar lesion using mp-MRI scan. We propose different model listed below:

- Convolutional Autoencoder (based on axial High b-value images)
- Siamese network (Based in one of axial High b-value or T2-Weighted images)
- Double siamese (Combining axial High b-value and T2-Weighted images)
- Triple siamese (Combining axial High b-value and T2-Weighted images and sagittal T2-Weighted images)
